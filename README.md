# movie_recommender_system
 This project is a movie recommender system using KNN and various data preprocessing techniques using Pipelines and ColumnTransformers. The goal is to recommend movies based on user preferences and movie attributes.

## Current Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning
- Feature engineering
- KNN-based recommendations
- NLP techniques for handling user input

## Future Enhancements
- Integration of deep learning models
- Comparison of multiple recommendation algorithms
- Automated model evaluation and selection



## Project Structure
- `data/`: Contains the datasets almost 5 thousand rows and 23 columns.
- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis and experimentation.
- `src/`: Source code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model fitting, NLP, Model Validation and Evaluation (manually).
- `README.md`: Project overview and instructions.
